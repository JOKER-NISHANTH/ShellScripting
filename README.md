##  What is Shell Scripting ?

A shell script is a list of commands in a computer program that is run by the Unix shell which is a command line interpreter.
A shell script usually has comments that describe the steps. 
The different operations performed by shell scripts are program execution, file manipulation and text printing.
A wrapper is also a kind of shell script that creates the program environment, runs the program etc.
